📝 Notes App

A simple and elegant React Notes App built using Tailwind CSS for styling.
It allows users to add, edit, and delete notes — all stored in localStorage, ensuring that your notes persist even after refreshing or closing the browser.

This app also uses React’s useEffect hook to keep data synchronized across multiple browser tabs in real-time.

🗑️ Delete notes instantly

💾 Data stored in localStorage (no backend required)
